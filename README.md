# fast-v3 experiments

Experimentation with key aspects of fastai v3 code

I too often find myself searching though the lesson notebooks for working examples of core aspects of fastai. 

Here I have put together notes grouping examples around particular topics.

learner:                    fit_one_cycle.ipynb

transfer learning:          models_transfer_learning.ipynb
